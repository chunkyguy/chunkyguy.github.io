![Sidharth Juyal]({{ site.url }}/assets/profile.jpg)

I make apps, games, graphics stuffs and something else I can't seem to recall... ah yes, jokes.

I've been working professionally on Apple platforms since 2008 using Swift, Objective-C, C++, C and whatever that gets the job done. 

Public work is available at [github](https://github.com/chunkyguy) and opinions on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chunkyguy).
