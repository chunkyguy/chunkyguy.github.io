Working on the all Apple platforms since 2008 using Swift, Objective-C, C++, C and whatever gets along.

I make apps, games, graphics stuffs and something more I can't recall.

Public work is available at [github](https://github.com/chunkyguy) and opinions on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chunkyguy). 

Don't take them too seriously, I'm still evolving. The impression you receive might be already obsolete.
