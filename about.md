**Who are you so wise in the ways of science?**

Hello there stranger and welcome to Whacky Labs, a sort of logbook for all sort of technological experiments I conduct in my free time.

Call me Sid. I make apps, games, 3D graphics stuffs and something else I can't seem to recall... ah yes, jokes. I've been making apps and games professionally since 2008 mostly using Swift, Objective-C, C++, C and whatever that gets the job done.
