## What am I doing here?

Either you followed one of my many white rabbits out there, or your friends tricked you into this space. Whatever be the reason, welcome to Whacky Labs!

## What exactly is whackylabs?

You can think of whackylabs as my hideout. This where I keep all my personal stuff. It's my personal space on the web. It's where I post all the things I love. You can think of whackylabs as my Dexter's Laboratory.

## Who are you?

I am Sidharth Juyal. I have been making iOS apps since 2008. I'm also a computer graphics enthusiast. As a hobby I've made several games using Coccos-2d, SpriteKit, Unity, and written Hideous Game Engine.
Oh, and yes I also have a Mater of Computer Applications college degree from Kumaon Engineering College, Dwarahat.

Did I tell you, I love meeting all kind of people? And there must be a billion topics to break the ice with me, football, music, literature, science, philosophy, games and of course programming. Just shoot anything.

Goodbye and have a nice day!
