One of the many goals I had for 2017 were:

1. Writing a ray tracer.
2. Restarting the blog.

# Writing a ray tracer

Sometime when the trees started to shed their leaves, and I was worried that I'm lagging way too much behind my goals of the year, I finally decided to order the book I wanted to read for many years now. The following day I placed an order for [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbrt.org). 

As I was close to finishing the first chapter, I realized I had never written a ray tracer. Although, people tend to claim that writing a ray tracer is the most natural and usually the first step in the beautiful world of computer graphics. Still, I had never written it. 

The closest I had ever been to understanding a ray tracer was when following the [dissection](http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/) of the mysterious and amusing [ray tracer on a business card](http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-01-12-card/). Next, I started following the articles on [https://www.scratchapixel.com](https://www.scratchapixel.com) about ray tracing, to get a more in depth understanding of how would one go in order to write a ray tracer from scratch.

Although, these blogs were tempting enough for me to start diving into writing my first ray tracer, but still I was too busy (read lazy) to actually do it. Then, one day I ran across the minibook [Ray tracing in one weekend](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8). Although the book was probably designed to be finished within a weekend, and rightfully so, still I took it really slow and maybe finished in about a month. 

For every chapter, I used to do my own side research as well. For example, when working on the camera, I would often go side track and read about the functionings of real life camera and how the appertures and depth of field are supposed to work. Also, while coding, I tried to write a bit modern-ish C++ and use the Apple simd library for all the math, which interestingly has no or very less online presence. For example, there is no proper documentation except for the header files, and probably deserves a proper blog post of its own.

In the end, today, just when the year is about to end, I was able to render the target image!

# Restarting the blog

Another thing I had planned to do for a very long time was restarting this blog. The death of this blog started with some miscommunication between me and my hosting service [Yahoo Small business India](https://india.yahoosmallbusiness.com). My service renew date was somewhere when they were making the transition to Aabaco, so every time I tried to renew my service I was receiving this try again later page. At the same time, I was also moving places. Later when I was finally settled and tried to renew the service again to my horror I received the email from them that due my failure to renew they had wiped my data from the server. 

Eventually, I transferred the domain name and built the blog up from whatever scrap I could find. This entire process had left me a bit wretched to say the least. Also, I was having hard time to find something interesting to focus on.

Finally, it was the goal of 2017 to restart the blog again, and I if this post is published before the dawn of 2018 I believe 2017 was a great year after all for me!
