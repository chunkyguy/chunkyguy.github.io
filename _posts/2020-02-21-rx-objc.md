I want to make a point that `NSInvocation` is a really powerful tool. If we do not care too much about a compiler type checking every single line of our code we can build a scalable [Rx](http://reactivex.io) implementation using `NSInvocation`. 

`NSInvocation` is an Objective-C message rendered as an object that can be passed around and invoked when required. Think of it as an old school closure which isn't anonymous, rather opaque in nature and doesn't implicitly captures any data, close to [C++ lambda expressions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda). `NSInvocation` is just a simple wrapper around a function, [function object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object) would be the best term to describe it.

`NSInvocation` is very verbose. Here's an example of an `NSInvocation` that captures the `print:` method:

```objc
NSInvocation *verbose = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:
                                        [self methodSignatureForSelector:@selector(print:)]];
[verbose setTarget:self];
[verbose setSelector:@selector(print:)];
```

 Since we are going to use `NSInvocation` quite a lot, it would be wise if we write a nice category to reduce verbosity a bit.

```objc
@implementation NSInvocation (RxConvenience)

+ (instancetype)invocationWithTarget:(id)target
                            selector:(SEL)selector
{
  NSInvocation *invoc = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:
                         [target methodSignatureForSelector:selector]];
  [invoc setTarget:target];
  [invoc setSelector:selector];
  return invoc;
}

@end
```

With this change the same expression as above can now be written as:

```objc
NSInvocation *lessVerbose = [NSInvocation invocationWithTarget:self
                                            selector:@selector(print:)];
```

## Rx

At the core of Rx is the idea of **producers**, **consumers** and **events**. A *producer* generates some *events* and a *consumer* listens to those *events*. Sometimes the data expected by the *consumer* is not exactly what the *producer* is emitting, in that case we need an **operator** that knows how to convert data from a form to another. Other times, a *consumer* needs to listen to *events* from more than one *consumers*, for that again we have an *operator* that can convert multiple data into a single data. As you can imagine these single purpose *operators* can be very powerful in building giant sophisticated systems for delivering events from *producer* to *consumer*. And this plumbing of many small components together to perform a bigger task is what makes Rx so great!

### Observables

So, before we go on writing any code lets imagine how do wish our Rx API to look like from the client perspective. If we have a simple `print:` method as

```objc
- (void)print:(NSNumber *)num
{
  NSLog(@"%@", num);
}
```

We would like Rx to expose a way to create a producer and a way to consume the events, something like:

```objc
- (void)run
{
  RxObservable *stream = [RxObservable observableFromArray:@[@1, @2, @3]];
  NSInvocation *printInvoc = [NSInvocation invocationWithTarget:self
                                                selector:@selector(print:)];
  [stream subscribe:printInvoc];
}
```

As a initial step let's define a base class called `RxObservable` that provides this interface. And since we don't want to bloat this class with every spec implementation, let's provide some factory methods to some internal implementation specific class.

```objc
@implementation RxObservable

+ (instancetype)observableFromArray:(NSArray *)array;
{
  return [RxArraySource createWithElements:array];
}

- (void)subscribe:(NSInvocation *)invocation;
{
    // Needs to be subclassed
}

@end
```

And then the actual implementation could look something like

```objc
@interface RxArraySource : RxObservable

+ (instancetype)createWithElements:(NSArray *)array;
- (void)subscribe:(NSInvocation *)invocation;

@end
```

```objc
@interface RxArraySource ()
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSArray *elements;
@end

@implementation RxArraySource

+ (instancetype)createWithElements:(NSArray *)elements;
{
  RxArraySource *instance = [RxArraySource new];
  instance.elements = elements;
  return instance;
}

- (void)subscribe:(NSInvocation *)invocation;
{
  for (id element in _elements) {
    [invocation setArgument:&element atIndex:2];
    [invocation invoke];
  }
}

@end
```

With that in place, our `run` method should be working as expected.

```

3
```

### Operators

Next lets see how can we go about writing an Rx operator. One of the most commonly used Rx operator is the `map` operator which simply converts data from one type to another. Again, thinking upside down, how would we want our API to look like in the end. 

If we have a standalone method like

```objc
- (NSNumber *)tenTimesOfNumber:(NSNumber *)num
{
  return [NSNumber numberWithInteger:[num integerValue] * 10];
}
```

We should be able to create a map operator which can then be plugged in with rest of the pipeline

```objc
- (void)run
{
  RxObservable *stream = [RxObservable observableFromArray:@[@1, @2, @3]];
  NSInvocation *printInvoc = [NSInvocation invocationWithTarget:self
                                            selector:@selector(print:)];
  NSInvocation *mapInvoc = [NSInvocation invocationWithTarget:self
                                 selector:@selector(tenTimesOfNumber:)];
  [[stream mapWithInvocation:mapInvoc] subscribe:printInvoc];
}
```

Lets extend our `RxObservable` to provide an interface for this, which again would be more like a factory method to an implementation specific class.

```objc
@implementation RxObservable

// ...

- (instancetype)mapWithInvocation:(NSInvocation *)invo
{
  return [RxMapOperator operatorFromStream:self withInvocation:invo];
}

@end
```

Notice since we are always passing `RxObservable` from our fat base class, we can easily chain `RxObservables` together. Now let's go and write `RxMapOperator`

```objc
@interface RxMapOperator : RxObservable

+ (instancetype) operatorFromStream:(RxObservable *)stream
                     withInvocation:(NSInvocation *)invoc;

@end
```

The thing to realize with a `map` operator is that it knows not a lot about the actual types. It is provided with an actual implementation from the client that knows how to map types. So `RxMapOperator` only needs to chain two methods, take returned value from one and pass it down to the another.

```objc
@interface RxMapOperator ()
@property (nonatomic, strong) RxObservable *stream;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSInvocation *invocUp;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSInvocation *invocDown;
@end

@implementation RxMapOperator

+ (instancetype) operatorFromStream:(RxObservable *)stream
                     withInvocation:(NSInvocation *)invoc;
{
  RxMapOperator *instance = [RxMapOperator new];
  instance.stream = stream;
  instance.invocUp = invoc;
  return instance;
}

- (void)transform:(id)arg
{
  [self.invocUp setArgument:&arg atIndex:2];
  [self.invocUp invoke];

  id ret;
  [self.invocUp getReturnValue:&ret];

  [self.invocDown setArgument:&ret atIndex:2];
  [self.invocDown invoke];
}

- (void)subscribe:(NSInvocation *)invocation
{
  self.invocDown = invocation;
  [self.stream subscribe:[NSInvocation invocationWithTarget:self 
                                        selector:@selector(transform:)]];
}

@end
```

With that in place our `run` method should now print

```

30
```

## Parting thoughts

This experiment was just to play around the idea of building something quick and dirty with `NSInvocation`. Obviously none of this code is production ready, but I think it can be expanded to cover all sort of building blocks for Rx patterns.
