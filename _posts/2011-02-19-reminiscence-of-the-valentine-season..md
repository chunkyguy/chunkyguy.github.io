This valentine season I enjoyed a personal Valentine Film Festival (although, it wasn’t my primary intention).
Here’s a list of movies I saw:

- Breakfast At Tiffany’s
- The Ugly Truth
- I hate luv storys

And ever since this crap is going around my head in circles, that I’m writing down.

What is common in all of these?
1. They are all chick flicks.(everyone knows that)
2. They all are centered around one theme: killing personal liberty of an individual.

Now, come one guys what is the matter with us, why can’t we accept that some people are never made to live in groups.

What might sounds warm and fuzzy for you might be kindda enslavement for others. One thing that still bothers me is, all these movies and the whole genre of these, have one storyline: there is a person at the beginning who wants to live wild and free, and is somehow able to achieve that successfully.

This is best portrayed in Breakfast At Tiffany’s where this girl Holly is living in a small apartment, with a cat with no name, a super-active social life, and carefree lifestyle, she loves the most. I would say, she’s enjoying the life what many girls can just fantasize about, a thing very hard of a small town girl to achieve, and even harder for somebody so gorgeous and coming from a mediocre family.

And so is the same with every protagonist following up this genre. Then, as the movie proceeds, there enters a somebody of opposite sex or something like that, who is attracted to such a person almost instantly, or as in case of The Ugly Truth, during a course of time. Or, it might even happen that the new person is living just the same way. Very good up till now.

Then something goes bad, and the other person starts thinking about falling in love, or fantasizing about getting married to our protagonist. Not good. First of all, its like killing the spirit of freedom that we all had been enjoying till now. Secondly, its a clear misuse of the liberty the protagonist had given to this outsider in his/her life.

By the time the movie is near end the new person starts torturing the protagonist emotionally or physically. Like in I hate luv storys(what a ironic name!),:

Simran tells Jay she needs to talk to him to tell him how she feels. When she gets there she sees Jay kissing another girl’s hand. She explains that she loves him and thinks he loves her. Jay explains that he never thought of her that way. After being heartbroken, she leaves….

And the opposition or suppression can be easily deduced from this scene of Breakfast At Tiffany’s where, Holly kicks out the cute cat and the guy (Paul) out of the cab, and wants to go to Brazil.

And, then by the time movie ends, the new person has tortured the protagonist so much that he/she decides to give in, and the most prominent weapon used against this is by making the protagonist realize how lonely he/she is, example, in Breakfast at Tiffany’s Paul says:

Paul Varjak: You know what’s wrong with you, Miss Whoever-you-are? You’re chicken, you’ve got no guts. You’re afraid to stick out your chin and say, “Okay, life’s a fact, people do fall in love, people do belong to each other, because that’s the only chance anybody’s got for real happiness.” You call yourself a free spirit, a “wild thing,” and you’re terrified somebody’s gonna stick you in a cage. Well baby, you’re already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it’s not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It’s wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.
[takes out the ring and throws it in Holly's lap]
Paul Varjak: Here. I’ve been carrying this thing around for months. I don’t want it anymore.

And that is it guys, thats when most of all drop our tears and expect a reconcile, or say something like wtf! why isn’t she/he marrying him/her, because thats exactly what you’d done at that moment.

Now comes the point I have been babbling on, you might desire that because you’re born to live in groups or families or couples or threesome or whatever, but not them! These people are different, and its not that they were lonely all by coincidence, but thats the way of life they’ve chosen, they’d worked hard to make that happen, and all in a instance its snatched away. These people were meant to live alone as long as they live and die some year later in solitude of their apartment or pavement or hotel room with drug overdose or suicide or natural death like we all do.

The thing that worries me is, wtf is wrong with the society? why can’t we just accept the fact that somebody might wanna live alone, why can’t we accept the fact that somebody can hate the whole idea of love/sex thing, or the package that comes with it; the responsibility, society, unwanted new circle of relatives and friends.

If a movie comes up that goes the same line but just doesn’t ends up the main actors hugging, kissing, fucking, cuddling,… why does that makes us sad. And there are numerous movies where much anticipated lovers don’t end up meeting, but either die, or get lost in time, but majority of those are who had desired to live together happily ever after.

I’m yet to watch a movie, where a person who wants to live all by himself/herself ends up rejecting the lascivious idea of living within the bounds of society and springing back to the original lifestyle that he/she started out with in the beginning.

One more fact to consider here is, that all these movies just end up at the sticking-together part, and never are we able to see what happens next. Everyone’s who’s been in or/and out of love, is well familiar with the fact that falling in love is entirely different feeling than being in love. So, lets assume by the time movie ends our protagonist is actually in love or at least the fantasy of love, but what really happens say after 2 years? Is he/she still happy?

The best of this feeling is also depicted in many movies like say “War of the Roses”, “Bridget Jone’s diary”, or “Erin Brockovich”, where the person just realizes that all the love and affection has just evaporated into some blackhole and they are just bound up doing house hold chores; dropping kids to school, shopping at the superstore, or doing dishes. And it might happen that during an argument this volcano of suppressed thoughts might just erupt resulting in a separation or divorce or just a bitterness lasting few days or months or years or lifetime. Why isn’t that part shown in these chick-flicks? or maybe as a sequel?

Yea.. I probably know most of you are thinking right now, chill up dude! its just a movie, and not a reality, if you’re really interested in reality there are other streams of cinema available, or watch Discovery channel or even better watch some hate-based stupid reality show on MTV :)

Or, you might say that if you want reality switch over to books, because the book has much stronger characters, emotions, is more elaborate as time is infinite, and all in all has a much realistic plot. Anyone, who’s read a book and seen the movie based on it should agree with me here.
It might end up that you didn’t like the Breakfast At Tiffany’s as a book as it isn’t inducing happier feelings in you, as the movie. But, again thats just you in pursuit of happiness, a person who want to live a no-strings attached life might enjoy that more.

So, if thats the argument, I just shut the fuck up, otherwise I’ve another theory cooking inside of me, thats based on how is nature’s way of dealing with this kind of situations or does nature really made all of humans to live in couples and families, seriously guys all of the humans! that around what, 6 billion, 7 billion!

BTW, this song from the movie I hate luv storys was awesome:



and so was this one from Breakfast At Tiffany’s:
