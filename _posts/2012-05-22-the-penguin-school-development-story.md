Lately, I’ve been working on this little game that I’m calling as The Penguin School, and it’s not final, your suggestions are more than welcome.

The story is of a little baby penguin learning the skills of tobogganing from his/her master Mr. Seal.

I’m still working on the graphics and the sound as is obvious from the snapshots.

I’ll keep this post updated as the game grows. All of your valuable suggestions, comments are welcome.
