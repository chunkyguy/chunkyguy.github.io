This is the main index for all my experiments.

This is the link to the repository for all the experiments. https://github.com/chunkyguy/EWOGL

1. OGLBasic: The Boilerplate. Just basic code to get a triangle on the screen.

2. Camera: The rotating cube.

3. Reflection: Rotating cube inside a triangle.

4. OBJLoader: Loading an OBJ file.
