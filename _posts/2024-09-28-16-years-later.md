So today I completed my 16 years of working professionally. This is a quick summary of the past year.

- Improved my javascript skills by deep diving into the javascript language design.
- Understood more about css. Things like animation, grid layout and just more basic things that I guess almost all web devs are supposed to know.
- Made a static portfolio webpage first using old school html-css-js and then again with react.js.
- Made a few prototypes using react-native and expo.
- Tried out new cross-platform mobile frameworks like .NET MAUI and Ionic.
- Made a small api only web service with MEN stack: mongodb, express.js, node.js.
- Rewrote my web service using AWS lambda, http-gateway, cognito, s3 and dynamodb.
- Expanded on my knowledge on SwiftUI.
- Started playing around with Swift structured concurrency. I mean like I had to with Xcode 16/swift 6 migration at our face.
