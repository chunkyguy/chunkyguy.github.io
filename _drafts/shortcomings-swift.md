1. Ability to expose write interface
- friend functions in C++ 
- objc extensions

2. Fix length mutable arrays
    let x: [Int] = [1,2,3]
- Like we have in C

3. Distraction free programming.
If I'm focused on the main algorithm, I get distracted by missing implementations of auxilary functions.
If I satisfy them with returning stub values, the compiler might never tell me that implementation is missing
